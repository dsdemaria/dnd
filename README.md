## Other Available Scripts

These scripts come with create-react-app and are not altered in anyway. In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.
tegrate it into Create React App even more closely.


Note that the server will use a self-signed certificate, so your web browser will almost definitely display a warning upon accessing the page.
